Generative AI with text
Wrirting better prompts
writting AI prompts a skill in itself

What is prompt engineering?
 It's a process in where you guide a generative AI solutions to generate the desired output.

How can I get the AI to do what I want. with the most efficient prompt, right? Shortest input, best output. That's what we want, right?

A prompt is a natural language text that requires… that requires generative AI to perform a specific task.
Goal of today  is how to make a better prompt.

Better control of the output, better user experience, Flexibility, and I will put another one in there, decreased cost. I will show you how to get the same output at a cheaper cost.

AI framework in which Google recommended.

Steps to AI frame work by google:

Task
   Persona(who the AI is)
  Format: Output type
          
Context[ In-class example]
Good : Give me some ideas for a birthday present. Under $30

Great: Give me 5 ideas fro a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is the a 29 yr old who love winter sports.

Reference:
Additonal input data ideas

Evaluate:
Did it give me the results I am looking for?

Iterate:
If code didnt work , you tell AI it didnt work and have it help fix the mistakes.  You start from the beggininig essential, trying to better your format.

-A skill to make a better promts

Example:
Og prompt:
Summarize the key data points and information in this report, create a verge visual diagram for the data, and shorten the key information into bullet points.

Better prompts: (lead to better output)
Summarize the key data into points.
create a visual graph
with data you summarized
shorten key information your into bullets  points

Example:
OG prompt:
Write a marketing plan 

Improved:
Write a story about how this product fits into the live of our target customer demographic

AI generator: [ PHIND]
Try and create weather cycle:
phind - good at including sources 
One thing to consider: Finds: has alot of grammatical errors
Practice: try it out and see what you get;

In-Class Example:
Come up with a shoe brand
With at least 3 different shoes.
All the shoes should have prices.
A description of what the shoe is, what the shoe is for.
Come up with a brand name, a slogan. So, go ahead and make a new AI chat.
Come up with this marketing plan for your new shoe business

SUMMARY:
During this lecture we discuss what prompt engineering is? Which is a process where you guide AI to generate the desired output. In other words, how can we make our prompt more efficient. The more efficient it is the less it costs. If you request AI to do something vague it’s going to generate an answer that will in the end require more instructions to have the final output desired. We went over some examples in class such as the birthday example. It touches on what is a good example versus what makes a great example. We also went over what leads to better prompt output. For examples, “write a marketing plan” vs “write a story about how this product fits into the lives of our target demographic”. We as class could agree the second prompt was more direct and specific. Overall, we learned that creating prompts that are more specific and direct can lead to better answers in the end.

 NOTES:

Things that have helped ppl gets jobs
Personal projects.
Today we're going to talk about work tasks and using AI for things that are productive. Including summarizations.
If you write a horrible prompt and give it horrible resources, it's gonna output garbage every time. So just, just remember that.

In-Class Example: Created a prompt to write an email. I chose Chat gpt 

So, I am a marketer for a well-known video game producer known for creating immersive, story-based online video games.
I plan to launch a new medieval fantasy roleplay game that follows the path of a young protagonist reseaching for their missing parther.
The game is reaching the end stages of the development, and I need to create a timeline before it goes live.
 Provide a rough timeline for the year leading up to its launch. Also provide somepre-launch ideas.
To help generate buzz around the game

Tip when asking the the AI chats to create content , I recommend not using your company name. If its a big company you dont want it to affect you long term, we dont know what AI does witht the information given from us.

What did the the prompt spit out. Was it ok?

Marketing up your prompt:
I want you guys to think about how to write a good prompt, because again, garbage in, garbage out.


Another in class example prompt: 
I have 10 employees.
Their employee numbers are 1-10
Create a table that tracks weekly staffing.
Create colums for a day, name and and shift (morning and afternoon).
-there should always be 2 employees schedules morning and after shifts
-Employees should not be scheduled for a morning shift on the following day after they were scheduled for an afternoon shift.
-shifts should be roughly equal across employees.
 
Output: it gave us a graph with a schedule.
If it's a one-off thing, Sure, maybe, but if this is a weekly thing…
I should probably make just a computer program to do this, or make a Google Sheet or Excel sheet to do this for me, right?
Food for thought : should Gemini have my employee schedule. Is it okay to include personal informatino into AI you do not control?

These are things you need to be thinking about, is that everything you put into AI
It is no longer yours.. Think of it as the same thing as posting onto social media, right?

What is summarization?

A lot of people are really leveraging AI to summarize stuff. From the most mundane things to really important things. I'm buying a new car, here's the loan agreement, summarize this for me, right? People are using it for literally everything, and more and more, it's becoming, like, the default

Gmail has summarize feature

cost more to do more prompts 
but more steps of prompts for it be more accure and efficient

In class -activity:
Messy Hair assignment 

SUMMARY:
Today in class we discuss tasks, using AI for things that are productive, and summarizing. If you write a bad prompt, expect a horrible output. A tip given in class is that it’s recommended not to use your company name because we do not know what AI does with the information, we give it. Also, we wouldn’t want the company’s information to be out and have long-term effects on the company, but it could also be something to be fired over. In the end, it’s like making a fb post where anyone could see it. So, one must be conscious of what is shared with AI.  It was also mentioned in class that AI is used a lot for summarization such as summarizing a book, articles, or even emails. Again, when asking for these specific questions it’s important to be specific and have more prompts to lead to better output.

NOTES: 

Resourceful Apps/Websites
Down detector -website/app
is all user-reported, so a website's down, you go to the website and say, hey, the website's down. It's a good metric.
To see, but, like, everything went down, yesterday, and right now, things are going down
fakeyou.com- tells you when websites are down.

Microsoft, a while ago, said that 30% of Microsoft's code is written by AI.

Microsoft claims windows 11 is killing SSDs
Windows 11 will kill your laptop

Summarazing work:
Breaking down larger projects into larger projects but also a good idea to ask AI it got that answer.

AI will alwasy lie about how it go the answer it does know.

Chain of Density??=
Attempts to gradually improve and densify data by repeatedly repeating it
-boiling down a large piece of text.
Into a highlight of some sort, a bulletin point, a paragraph

Original Document ->
Prompt Summarize the text-->
Generate summary-->
Is the summary consise enought?-->
 Yes?--> Final, Consise Summary
NO?-->prompt:summarize the previous summary

Example= you can ask it to summarize a 30 page document but it will probably not get the best summary or the main points
Something that helps that is Chain of Density

AI doesnt have all info, for example its trained on open sourced data. example Principal still has Cobolt and its closed source data. So AI knows basics but wil not be able to help you with fixing or coding anything related to it.
It will hallucinate anything it doesnt know.

RAG??--
To go beyond the limitations of vanilla LLM.
They just do not have specific data and are not trained on proprietary or super unique data sets
So how do we solve for this?
We use something called RAG.

On the job, you're gonna have something called a intranet.
-its only in the company datat base/ all internally
They have built Their own intranet over the course of years, or their own just documentation, whatever.
They have now put that into a data pool, or data lake of some sort and then allowed the AI to… To look at it

AI is not running locally, not open source, it's not in some kind of…
air gap, salute them, then yeah, the data's just gonna go back to the AI companies, right? And if you're gonna do that, you might as well just post it on the internet to begin with, right?

Used Vercel notes and have it summarize.

what an agent means in AI? Agentic
whatt an agent does ?
It can atually do things in the real world. It can actually email, it can actually post a YouTube video, or it can actually edit the text directly.

One thing to is to becarefull with it bc it can delete you info bc it edits directly

An agent is a AI tool that can actually do stuff. it can autonomously decide to do something without human input.
Agents have access to tools. So, again, instead of just being able to output text into the prompt window, they can actually do something. So, like, they can use a piece of software to edit a video.

They can not only write the code, they can run the code, run the tests.
See the results of the test, and then edit the code based on the results of the test.

They can do multi-step planning, so again, like here, it thought, it researched, it thought, it acted, right? It can do a multi-step plan.
And it can be self-correcting

A big problem with LLMs is that they never admit ignorance, and will constantly be wrong

Perplexity:
you can, in fact, again, upload a file, or give it an entire
Website, so you can just give it the link of your company website.
And it will search through that website and give you more correct answers.

SUMMARY:
Today in class we touched base on the outage from yesterday. It was mentioned that some sites that keep track of outages are Down Detectors and fakeyou.com. They are both great ways to keep track of sites that are down. The professor also showed us an article that claims windows 11 is killing SSDs. So, Windows 11 is killing our laptops. We also revisited on what the meaning of summarization is.  Some tips to have AI generators give us the desired output we need. Such as breaking down larger projects into multiple prompts and it also a good idea to ask AI how it got the answer. As AI will always lie about how it got the answer because it defaulted to give an answer.  Another method mentioned to help generate desired output is Chain of Density. The Chain of Density is attempting to gradually improve and densify data by repeating asking it what we desire. We also learned what Agent in Ai means and can do. We can essentially run on automanual with human input and has tools to write code, run test and make changes in real time. Which can be a great thing and have its cons. We also touched base on open-sourced data and close data. Typically, AI is trained on open-sourced data so if you are asking it questions regarding a certain top it will give you general answer but will most likely not be accurate. Once again, the AI will generate an answer to generate an answer.
