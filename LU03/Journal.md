NOTES 09/08

What is MultiMedia?
Any type of media, like we have been talking about AI generators. Thats a type of multimedia.

Text to Speech (TTS)
It’s been around since the dawn of time.

Voice Cloning
Text to Video/Image to Video

We will do some video generation today. Now, AI video generation is probably the youngest technology we'll look at this class
When generating a Video, having a reference image is best. You will get the best results.
Video clips on almost all these video generators, just the free ones, are usually, like, 3-5 seconds long, so just have that expectation. You tell the AI to do all these different things. It only has 3 to 5 seconds to do it

Prompted: on LUVVOICE to generate audio of our sentence

Today's lecture, we explored how artificial intelligence is changing our media creation.

Fakeyou: Another generator that can create voice audio from text

People can use these tools to do horrific things, so it can be pretty horrible. 
Try and be careful which you use, some voices that are well known are copyrighted and you can get sued for utilizing and posting them.

Footage-another app that makes free videos from instructions
prompted an image and text to get a video

HW: 
So, you guys need to go out in between classes and download these. If you guys want to use a different tool than me, feel free.
Download:
GIMP
Handbrake
Kdenlive

SUMMARY:
 During this lecture it mainly focused on what is multimedia which is essentially any type of media. During this lecture, it was mentioned that Text to Speech (TTS) isn’t necessarily new it has been around for a long time. In class we used LUVVOICE to generate and audio out of the text we input. Another type of multimedia would be Voice cloning, which can be pretty neat but could also be used for bad reasons and cost damage to someone’s persona. When it comes to Voice Cloning, one thing one must watch out for is that the voice is not copyrighted as one can get in legal issues. There are many apps out there that one can pay for and as well as free services that help with voice cloning, TTS and editing apps.



Notes 09/09

Today, we're going to learn how to use some of those media creation tools, a quick craft course.
Tools that will be discussed in class/crash course of these tools:
Handbrake
GIMP
Kdenlive

HW: 
Wednesday, Thursday, you guys will need to make your own video. The AI video will be pretty rough, so you will need to piece it together using a tools Kdenlive.
Today we learned how to utilize Kdenlive:
How you can add a video and edit a video
Cutting sections and putting them back together 

Next, we're going to talk about compression.

Handbrake- helps compress

Alright, have you guys ever heard of the triangle? There are 3 things. Speed.
The end file size and quality. Pick two. You don't get all three. You can get a small file that's high resolution; it's going to take a long time. You can get a small file. Another thing we can do is compress the audio. 
It’s all speed versus quality. Every online platform does this. When you upload a video, it compresses it.
YouTube, Facebook, they all do it in different ways of different technologies. Some of them use, like, very standard technology, like H264. Sometimes they develop their own. Like, YouTube developed AV1 encoding

GIMP:
Is a free open source, video, photo editor. Why would you need this in your, AI slop?
The thumbnail. Thumbnails, the most important part. The thumbnail. When you export it, guess what it asks you? For compression. You can't compress the image. So right here, this is… that's what this is. The quality is how compressed do you want.
Default is 9% quality.
And with compression, it's always a drop-off effect, meaning
You lose just a little bit of quality, and you get a much smaller size, but the smaller size you get, the quality usually just really drops off. There's just kind of a limit to how far you can go. That's why it goes to, like, 9 by default.

You guys are going to come up with your Git Quitch get rich quick speed. So, find a niche online. For me, it would probably be space, like space travel, like NASA kind of stuff. That would probably be my niche.
So, I'm going to make videos about… Cuban space program, whatever, right?
And then, you're going to come up with your workflow.

And then you're going to use this plan to make a demo. So, we're only going to make one piece of content, but with the workflow, we should be able to generate tons of content.
The idea of the workflow is to do as little human intervention, right? Copy-paste, right?

At the end, so on Monday next week, you guys are going to present to What your target audience is.
Your workflow diagram, what tools you used.
And then you're going to show your demo, so your video.
And then you're going to… Talk about what you learned.
The content doesn't have to be a video, it can either it can be a podcast, you can make a song if you guys want to. I'm open to anything, just not text. If you guys are going to make, like, a social media thing, make sure it has, like, a photo, photos or, like, videos or something.
So again, I want you guys to come up with your own scheme, your get-rich-quick scheme. Any questions about what we're doing tomorrow? That's why I showed you these tools, is that you're going to have to use these tools to some degree.

SUMMARY:
During this lecture we had crash course on how to use Handbrake, GIMP, and Kdenlive. We utilize each one of the programs, so we got some hand-on practice on how to utilize these tools. But also, we can use them on our upcoming homework project. It was very neat to utilize the tools we went over in class. While this technology has come a long way, these tools can be used to create this audio, adjust them, and have them create videos. In the wrong hands, it could cost someone’s job. If they ultimately look very real. 


NOTES 09/10

Mentioned windows 10 is coming to its end of life
Windows is propriety 
With no updates you data is not secure
You can get hacked /compromised without these updates 
Got into groups to work on the group project

SUMMARY:
Went over what’s expected from group project and the rest of the time was utilized to work on the project in class.



NOTES 09/11

There's a new iPhone, where they announced the new iPhones. I want to hear your opinion. 
Why and are guys interested?
Purposefully thin phone. Is that something you would like to have?

Class small discussion- I would not want the newer iPhone that’s thin in my opinion. It just looks easily breakable. As someone that drops their phone a lot maybe it would be for me.

Working on Group Project
Professor over assignments due

SUMMARY:
Today class time was utilized for work time to work on the assignment. We had a small little discussion about the new iPhone coming out. The new iPhone would be lightweight and very thin. If that was something we would be interested in purchasing? I personally would not, as someone that drops their phone a lot it may not be the best fit for me.
