    No video was uploaded. But I assumme we went over the syllabus and expectations. I have read and
    went over the syllabus.

NOTES:
    AI is biased based on the people that made the AI.

    AI is trained by data.

    An algorithm is really just a mathematical formula. The difference of artificial delta generative AI and a algorithm is that the output of an algorithm can almost always be determined. AI is not deterministic.

    Based on data from time frame of 2022 and prior years before.

    Any new facts or newer data of newer years it does not know.

    Making prompt efficient to get result you need.

    Tokenized: We pay for token, the input, the output.

SUMMARY
    Today in class we touhed base on how AI can be biase. Just like people can be biase so can AI as its made by people
    also prone to be biase. We also touched base on how AI is trained, which is trained by data given to it. One thing 
    that i found interesting its that the data it's trained is from years prior to 2022. So if we ask it anything recent it may 
    not be really accurate. I found that really insteresting and over all how it creation came to be. I guess, I've had not given
    it much thougth. I've known AI had been a thing for a while but honestly didnt give it a try until this year.

    Airplanes have a 100 watt hour limit, because they don't want the plane to fire.

    When you use AI, So when you go to ChatGBT, Where is that computing happening?
    In the cloud.
    Any computer, happens in the server side

    Carbon footprint- 
    leaves a trail
    If you sent an Email
    uses about -1.7 cent of electricity 

    Everything you do on the internet has a carbon footprint.

    Chat GPT-free

    So that is one ethical dilemma with AI, is that it costs electricity to use, just like 
    anything, but we'll see on the scale what it looks like later.

    AI companies use those transcripts to train AI. So if you ask ChatGPT about, how do I do this thing in Minecraft.

    Just because something is publicly available doesn't mean it is for use to do whatever.

     AI used public information to train AI without people's permission.

    How Cameras. Yeah, so cameras, how people are biased.

    His new thing called AI psychosis???
    Schizophrenic tendencies.
    If you message the AI, well, it mightâ€¦
    encourage or give in to those tendencies, right? So if you're saying you're seeing something that's not real,
     or you're seeing Visms, and you tell AI, it might agree with you.

    How individuals talk to AI for hours on end, and eventually it does just give in to your kind of fantasies or crazy beliefs, saying, like, yeah, you should stop taking your medicine, or yes, you should go kill that person. It is a thing that has been happening.

    DEBATE TOPIC
    Does AI in education reduce learning? Do people always use AI to avoid critical thinking? Or is it a tool for learning?

SUMMARY
    During this lecture we touced base on examples of how AI can be biase. One of the examples talked about in class was about a research
    study was done on how a social media program would auto crop picture perfectly for individuals who are cacasian. But when the symtem 
    tried the same thing for people of color. The system seemed confused and would crop the images randomly. Which is problamatic, you want AI to be able to be accomdation to all peoople. That just goes to show their is work to still be done to perfect AI. One thing I found interesting, is the cost of electricity AI causes. Once again, I had not thought of the electricity AI requires and what the long term effects would be to society. Eventually it will cost peoople in the future, we just dont see it right now. I had heard of AI psychosis per social media, and had not heard how it cause it. But I can definitely see how that can happen now and Im glad people
    are aware now and take the require precations to avoid that. Lastly, the class had a debate, about how AI impacts education. Which I found very interesting. I personally have mixed feeling about AI, its love hate relationship. I can definitely see both sides. Some of the things I like about it, is that it has helped me understand my classes more. I used it for reassurance more and if im not
    understand something I ask it to break thing down. I will do voice and tell it what ive understood, and it will tell yes, you understood the subject or your close, let fine tune somethings. I how it modifyes to my learning style, which I think is important. Everyone learns differently, what works someone might not work for someone else. But I can also see how easy it can be use to avoid doing any work or how it can affect critical thinking in the long run.

        AI's types:
    chat gpt -not open source
    gemini
    Snap chat IA
    Grok
    DeepSeek-open source
    Veo2
    Perplexity
    Olama
    Curling AI

    Deep A

    Gemini owned and operated by Google

    Windows-
    that's because Windows is proprietary closed-source software.
    You have no control of what the software does. You have no idea how it works. It's proprietary and closed source.

    The opposite of that is free open supper. Now, when I say free, I don't mean free as a beer, I mean freedom. Free.
    The GNU, Foundation defines Paris as
    users have freedom to copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.

    It's a free open source operating system-androids and linux

    Free open source AI??
    Knowing the training data set 
    how AI was trained
    run locally

    just bc it runs locally does not mean it open source

    Open source meaning- with open source software, users should have the ability to use, study, modify, and share the system without restrictions. This includes the model weights, so that users can enable modifications and do fine-tuning, and even contribute back to the model itself.
    Data openess

    Resources required to run different AI models.

    AI companies do not have to
    say how much electricity they use. 

    AI industry is very, energy hungry

SUMMARY
    During this lecture we touched base how many differnt types of AI models are available to use. We also touced base on the ethical 
    dilema of how AI was trained. Its said it was trained on public information, but company are outrage because theyre data was used
    to trained AI, but in theory public information is free. One thing metioned in class was that, AI was used youtube transcrits from 
    youtube to be trained, should the companies have asked permission to use that data? Or since its public info its a free for all.
    From my perspective, I definitely feel like some notice or contract should have been given but I see can how companies can get away with it as,it public information. Lasty, we touched base on if AI models should be open sourced or closed sourced. Being open source
    means knowing how AI was trained, what data was used, and it being able to run locally. I think they should be open sourced, we
    should be able to see how its trained and off what information its being based off, for transparancy reasons.
